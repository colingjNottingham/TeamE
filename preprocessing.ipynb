What do you think should be done with this entry? I would suggest that it make sense to combine the two rows into one, and add the total number of orders together - this looks like the same customer has created two accounts. Do you agree? This demonstrates that deciding what to do about duplicate and near-duplicate entries isn't trivial - you need to think about the context of the data. If you are confident with coding, write some code in the next block to do this - this is rather challenging, though, so you might want to move on to the next task."

Remember that if people ordered in \"Packets\" then that is packets of twelve coffee pods, and that the final format requires \"Total Orders\" to be in terms of individual pods. So, write some code in the next block that loops through the rows, and if the \"Order Type\" is Packets, multiplies the \"Order Total\" column by 12. For consistency, you should then change the \"Order Type\" to Individual, though you could perhaps neglect this because we are going to delete the \"Order Type\" column soon because it is not needed in the final format."
